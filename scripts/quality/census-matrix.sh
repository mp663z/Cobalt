# Device census matrix: every catalog app in a fresh simulator at every
# supported device profile x every text scale. 27 cells = 9 profiles
# (kobo-profile SUPPORTED_PROFILES) x 3 scales (default, large, extra-large).
#
# Results land OUT_ROOT/<profile>-<scale>/out/results.json and the aggregate
# census JSON+MD are written by census-summarize.py.
#
# Recipe notes (learned 2026-09-18):
# - Profile comes from KOBO_SIM_PROFILE, scale from KOBO_TEXT_SCALE; the sim
#   validator lives in the freshly built kobo-cli, so build it first.
# - Run with the RELEASE binary for speed: cargo build --release -p kobo-cli,
#   then keep target/debug/kobo as a copy of it (check-apps-sim.py drives
#   target/debug/kobo).
# - Portrait cells only. Landscape is an app-owned SetOrientation choice, not a
#   device-level re-render (kobod/src/device.rs); apps with their own rotation
#   control get measured-reflow checks through that control instead.
# - 758x1024 is NOT a supported profile; do not add it.
# - No source edits while the matrix runs: every cell must measure the same
#   tree. 4-way parallel (cells are wait-bound, CPU idles).
