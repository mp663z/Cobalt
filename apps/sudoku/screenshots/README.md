# Sudoku screenshots

Actual SDK app in the Clara BW simulator at 1072 × 1448 with extra-large interface text. These are ideal grayscale simulator frames, not physical-reader captures. All puzzles are original and bundled with the app.

The public app page uses `game.png` at `docs/media/site/apps/sudoku.png`. Each source capture records binary and source digests, fonts, profile, text scale, orientation and fixture identity. Landscape captures retain the physical panel orientation recorded by the CLI.

Build `kobo-cli` from this checkout, then run `scripts/quality/check-sudoku-sim.py --output /tmp/sudoku-check --scale extra-large` using the same cargo target directory. Capture metadata records dirty source accurately when a documentation update follows validation.
