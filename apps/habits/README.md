# Habits

A fully offline habit tracker. Habits and completions stay on the reader;
nothing connects an account or uploads progress. Settings can export a backup
as a verified text copy for your paired computer; the original stays on the
reader.

## Repaint policy

Tapping a habit repaints that row once for its checked state.
