//! arXiv, for reading rather than for downloading.
//!
//! Eight thousand preprints a week land on arXiv, and the way anybody finds
//! the handful worth their evening is by browsing a subject's newest listing
//! or searching for a phrase. Both are one query to the same export API, so
//! that is the whole of this application: a list of subjects, a search box,
//! and somewhere to actually read what comes back.
//!
//! ## Why the abstract is the document
//!
//! A paper on arXiv is a PDF, and this platform's reader does not read PDFs.
//! That could have made this a catalogue with nothing behind it -- a list that
//! ends at a title. It does not, because arXiv has served an HTML rendering of
//! every paper submitted since December 2023, and that is real prose the
//! reader can set. So a paper opens on its abstract, which always exists, and
//! offers the full text when arXiv has one to give. A paper too old for the
//! rendering says so plainly rather than opening an empty page.
//!
//! ## Why the listing is fetched a page at a time
//!
//! The API answers a query with as many entries as you ask for, and asking for
//! a thousand is one long fetch that fills memory with papers nobody scrolled
//! to. Twenty-five is about four screens of rows, which is as far as anybody
//! goes before either opening something or changing the query.

Existing comparisons confound these axes, making it unclear whether their observed differences stem from what is being optimised vs. how it is being optimised. We disentangle the two by introducing two new tokenisation algorithms that complete this 2x2 design space: BottomUpLL, a bottom-up likelihood-based tokeniser, and TopDownComp, a top-down compression-based tokeniser.
