# Sync

Sync is the Settings surface for Cobalt's runtime-owned Syncthing service. It
persists the on/off state and cadence, reads runtime-written transfer status,
and shows the fixed receive-only `vault`, `frame`, and `books` folders plus
send-only `out`.

The status screen shows the whole picture at a glance: transfer state, bytes
remaining, peers online, the last successful window, the next scheduled
window, and - when the engine gives up on a file for now - a distinct
conflict state that retries on the next window. Completed windows import
staged packages onto the application shelves (`sync/vault` becomes Vault's
synced shelf, `sync/frame` becomes the Frame album; deletions never
propagate) and the screen lists what each import brought in. The first
completed sync is called out once.

`kobod --syncthing window 300` starts a bounded owner-attended window;
`tail` limits opportunistic windows to 90 seconds, `scheduled` honours the
stored cadence, and `status` reports the latest runtime status.

The supervisor
generates configuration in `/var/lib/cobalt/syncthing`, makes a daemon-only
API key from `/dev/urandom`, and only permits its REST listener on loopback.
It accepts neither arbitrary folder paths nor a key supplied by an app. A
clean REST shutdown is attempted before a last-resort kill.

The unmodified ARMv7 Syncthing binary and a persistent scheduled-wake launcher
are still required on an actual Kobo platform image. Until the binary arrives
through the platform-update channel, the app surfaces the install remedy.

## Pair one host directory

The host CLI creates a separate Syncthing identity and home at
`~/.config/kobo/syncthing`; it never edits another Syncthing installation.
Install Syncthing with the computer's package manager, wake the Kobo on Wi-Fi,
then map one real directory to one fixed Kobo folder:

```sh
kobo sync setup ~/Documents/notes --folder vault --device 192.168.1.2
kobo sync run
kobo sync status
kobo sync stop
```

`vault`, `frame`, and `books` are send-only on the host and receive-only on the
Kobo. `out` is the inverse, and its host directory must be empty at first
setup. Setup obtains both real Syncthing device IDs, adds only the chosen
folder to the pairing, rejects symlinked or overlapping roots, and prints the
attended Kobo window command. `run` starts only the dedicated peer in the
background; `run --foreground --seconds 300` provides a bounded alternative.
The API remains on `127.0.0.1:8385`, while LAN discovery, global discovery,
and relays remain enabled for direct and remote transfers.

## ARMv7 release path

`build-armv7.sh` is deliberately build-only: it requires a locally reviewed,
pinned upstream checkout and a caller-provided output directory. It does not
download or execute a release artifact. It pins Syncthing `v2.0.9` commit
`3382ccc3f16536b5a7b6df7c8212951f7d4d3a9f`, runs `go mod verify`, and refuses
an output that differs from the repository-pinned SHA-256.

The engine is not part of the platform package. It was 27.9 MB of a 31.0 MB
release, which every reader downloaded on every update whether or not they use
Sync, so it is published once under the `syncthing-v2.0.9` tag and `kobod`
fetches it the first time somebody turns Sync on. Running this script proves
those published bytes can be rebuilt from the pinned source; the same rebuild
runs on demand in `.github/workflows/syncthing-engine.yml`.

`kobod` compares the fetched engine to the same digest compiled into the
runtime; it refuses a symlink, group/world-writable, non-root-owned, or
mismatched engine before spawning it, whether the bytes arrived over the
network or in an older platform package.

Choosing hourly, four-hourly, or daily in the app requests Cobalt's bounded
scheduled-wake facility; manual mode and Pause cancel it. A scheduled launcher
must run `kobod --syncthing scheduled`, which checks the persisted setting
again immediately before opening a five-minute maximum window.
