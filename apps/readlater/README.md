## Features

- Unread, Starred and Archive tabs.
- Articles are saved on the reader for offline reading, with Unicode and
  paragraph breaks intact. The collection is capped at 8 MiB.
- Star and archive articles offline. The changes sync to Wallabag next time.
- A failed refresh keeps the current list and offers **Sync** to retry. A
  failed save keeps the previous copy and offers **Retry saving**.

Save links with Wallabag's own browser or phone tools, then sync them here.

## Setup

1. On your Wallabag server, create an API client (on wallabag.it: **Settings →
   API clients**) and save its client secret to a private file.
2. Sign in from your computer. The password is read from
   `KOBO_WALLABAG_PASSWORD`, or from `--password-env VAR` or
   `--password-file PATH`, and never appears on the command line.

   ```sh
   kobo readlater login --server https://wallabag.example \
     --client-id ID --client-secret-file SECRET_FILE \
     --username you@example.com --device IP
   ```

This completes Wallabag's sign-in and sends the session to the reader, which
renews it on its own. The token can only be sent to your Wallabag server, and
the password is not stored on the reader. The client secret and refresh token
remain in private app state so the reader can renew the session. Run it again
only if you revoke access.

Alternatively, install a bearer token with
`kobo secret set wallabag --from TOKEN_FILE --device IP` and enter your HTTPS
server address in Settings.

## Permissions

- `network`: syncs with your Wallabag server.

## Development

```sh
cargo test -p kobo-readlater
python3 scripts/check-apps-sim.py readlater
```

The simulator check builds the app, opens it in a fresh simulator and plays
`drive.kobo`.
