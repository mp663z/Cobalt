# Birds third-party notices

Birds is explicitly inspired by the awesome [fugleramme](https://github.com/arnegiacomo/fugleramme) project by Arne Giacomo Munthe-Kaas. This credit is separate from, and in addition to, the license terms below.

The Cobalt Birds package contains no third-party code, model, artwork, or font.
It interoperates over HTTP with separately installed Fugleramme and BirdNET-Go.

## Fixture and screenshot artwork

The fixture collage (`scripts/fixtures/birds/current.png`), the checked-in
screenshots derived from it, and the documentation site image are a composite
of public-domain ornithological plates hosted by Wikimedia Commons. Each plate
is marked public domain on its file page. Rebuild the composite with
`scripts/fixtures/birds/build-collage.py`.

## Photographs of a reader in use

`docs/media/apps/birds/birds-on-a-clara-bw.{jpg,gif,mp4}` are photographs and a
recording of a Kobo Clara BW running Birds. What is on the screen in them is a
collage rendered by a separately installed Fugleramme from its **classic**
artwork, which is not the public-domain fixture above.

That artwork is offered under
[CC BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) as digital
restorations edited for Fugleramme, over source plates by the von Wright
brothers, John Gould and others. Per-plate sources are listed in Fugleramme's
own [`assets/artwork/classic/ATTRIBUTION.md`](https://github.com/arnegiacomo/fugleramme/blob/main/assets/artwork/classic/ATTRIBUTION.md)
and `manifest.json`, which name the work each file came from.

These three files therefore carry CC BY-SA 4.0 with attribution to Fugleramme
by Arne Giacomo Munthe-Kaas. They are documentation of the application and are
not part of the Birds package: no Fugleramme artwork is compiled into, shipped
with, or installed by Birds itself.
