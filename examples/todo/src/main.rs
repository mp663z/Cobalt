//! A list of things to do, which is where a platform's state model shows.
//!
//! It replaced a counter, because a counter demonstrates that a number can go
//! up and nothing else. This exercises the four things an application on this
//! device actually has to get right:
//!
//! - **State that outlives the process.** The list is written through
//!   [`kobo_sdk::AppStore`], so closing the application and opening it again
//!   shows the same list. Nothing here knows where that is stored, and there
//!   is no path it could name.
//! - **Actions that change one thing.** Tapping a row completes it. Only that
//!   row changes, so the runtime repaints that row rather than the screen,
//!   which on this panel is the difference between a flicker and a flash.
//! - **A state, drawn as the renderer sees fit.** A finished item is struck
//!   through and muted. The application never asks for a line through text; it
//!   says the item is done.
//! - **Typing, only where it is unavoidable.** Adding an item needs words, so
//!   the keyboard is raised for exactly that and put away again afterwards.
//!
//! ## Why the list is saved on every change
//!
//! There is no save button and no "are you sure". E Ink devices are closed by
//! shutting a cover and are forgotten until the battery is flat, so any design
//! that relies on a clean exit loses data. Each write is atomic, so the worst
//! a power loss can cost is the change that was in flight.
