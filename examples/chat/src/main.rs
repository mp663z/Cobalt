//! A chat client for a device with no keyboard worth the name.
//!
//! Three screens and one rule. The rule is that the reader should have to
//! type as little as possible: typing here means hunting for keys on a panel
//! that takes tens of milliseconds a repaint, so the model is asked to offer
//! tappable answers wherever a question genuinely has them, and those answers
//! are drawn with the same [`ScreenBuilder::choose`] a native screen would
//! use. It is asked just as firmly not to do that every turn, because a
//! conversation that answers every remark with a menu is a form.
//!
//! ## The key
//!
//! This application never sees it. [`Task::Post`] carries the *name* of a
//! secret; the runtime resolves that against its own directory and attaches
//! the `Authorization` header itself. Nothing here reads it, holds it, logs
//! it, or could put it in a crash dump, and a test asserts the request body
//! contains nothing key-shaped.
//!
//! ## Why nothing moves
//!
//! There is no spinner and no animation, here or anywhere in this system.
//! Waiting is stated once with [`ScreenBuilder::activity`] and the panel then
//! holds that image at zero power until there is something new to say.
