//! The permission prompt, moved to the armchair.
//!
//! A coding agent on the desk stops to ask "may I run this?" and the asking
//! goes wherever this reader is. The sidekick daemon on the computer catches
//! the question through the agent's own hook system and holds it; this
//! application collects it over one long-polled fetch, prints the command in
//! full, and offers exactly three answers under a thumb: Allow, Deny, and
//! leave it for the terminal.
//!
//! The design rule is that the panel earns its repaints. An empty poll asks
//! again without drawing anything; a question repaints once and then the
//! panel holds it at zero power for as long as the decision takes, which is
//! the one thing this screen does better than the phone it replaces.
//!
//! Pairing is typed once and remembered: the daemon's address, then the
//! six-character code `kobo-sidekickd init` printed. The code rides every
//! request so nobody else on the network can watch the questions or answer
//! them, and the connection is TLS against a root the owner installed with
//! `kobo trust set`.
