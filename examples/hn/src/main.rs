//! Hacker News, on a panel with no scrollbar and no keyboard.
//!
//! Five destinations along the bottom. Four are the site's own lists (Top,
//! New, Ask, Show) and the fifth is what this reader put aside, which is the
//! one that works with the radio off. Behind every story is its discussion,
//! and behind a story with a link is the article itself, read here rather
//! than left on a site nobody can reach from this device.
//!
//! ## One item per request, on purpose
//!
//! Hacker News' own API answers one item at a time, which is more round trips
//! than a search index needs. It is worth every one of them: it is the site's
//! own record, so a story submitted a minute ago is in the list, every score
//! is the score on the page, and `kids` is the order the site draws replies
//! in. A client cannot recompute that ordering, and a ranked search index
//! answering thirty at once got Ask HN wrong by thirteen years.
//!
//! Comments are fetched as the reader pages into them, so the radio a thread
//! costs tracks how far it was actually read rather than how popular it is.
//!
//! ## What the device remembers
//!
//! Which stories have been opened, and which were put aside. The site keeps
//! both for a logged-in reader and will keep neither for an application, and
//! the alternative to keeping them here is asking somebody for their Hacker
//! News password so that a list can be grey where they have already been.
