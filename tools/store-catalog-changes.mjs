// Everything whose content reaches a reader through the signed Store catalog.
//
// `apps/` holds the registry and every Store-only package. Host drive scripts
// and package README files use the same exclusions as the release checker.
// Registered packages that still live under `examples/` are watched by their
// workspace directory, because those binaries are the same ones the catalog
// signs. Device-only examples (launcher, settings, store, terminal, hello)
// are not in the catalog and are not watched here.
//
// `crates/`, `Cargo.toml`, `Cargo.lock`, `rust-toolchain*` and `.cargo/` are
// deliberately absent. Those are device-package inputs. A platform release
// carries them; demanding a catalog republish for them is what turned a
// Nickel-supplicant fix into sixteen Store version bumps and a red publish
// job. The next Store publication of an actually edited app compiles against
// whatever the platform then is.

// A drive script is the host-side route used to film an application. It is
// never compiled into the signed bundle, so adding or editing one must not
// look like a Store package change. That mistake is what turned a simulator
// recording script into a forced version bump of every example that grew one.
//
// Matching only drive.txt and drive.kobo let it happen again as soon as an
// application needed more than one route: a shelf of thirty-six applications
// grew drive.sh, drive-states.kobo, drive-empty.kobo, and a drive/ directory
// of scenes, and every one of those counted as a release input. So the whole
// family beside the package is named here, and only beside the package —
// src/drive.txt is source and a sibling directory is another package.

// it still told readers to export an environment variable for a packaging
// step that no longer exists -- was refused as an unreleased change to the
// Syncthing application, and the remedy on offer was to publish a new version
// of it to every reader who has it in order to fix a paragraph none of them
// download.
//
// The screenshots/ folder beside a package is the README's pictures, and the
// same argument holds. The app page publishes its images from docs/media/site,
// not from here, and no app compiles one in. Refreshing fifteen stale README
// stills after an interface change was refused as fifteen unreleased apps,
