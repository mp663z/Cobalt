//! Preparing a stock reader over USB, before there is any way in.
//!
//! Every other command in this tool needs a network address and an SSH server.
//! A reader out of its box has neither, and no way to get either: `start.sh`
//! needs a shell to run it, and a `NickelMenu` entry needs `NickelMenu`. So the
//! first install has to happen over the USB cable, against a filesystem that
//! the reader itself is not running from.
//!
//! # What this is allowed to touch
//!
//! Only the book partition, the FAT volume that appears when the cable is
//! plugged in. Nothing here writes to the system partition, and nothing here
//! is extracted as root.
//!
//! That rule is worth stating plainly because the obvious way to do this
//! violates it. Dropping a `KoboRoot.tgz` into `.kobo/` makes the firmware
//! unpack it **as root, at `/`, at the next boot**, which is how every other
//! Kobo modification is distributed. It is also the one mechanism on the
//! device that can leave it unbootable: a bad path in that archive overwrites
//! part of the running system, and there is no recovery short of a firmware
//! reflash. Cobalt's archive is confined to `.adds/cobalt` and would be
//! harmless, but the mechanism does not check that, the archive does.
//!
//! So this does not use it. [`write_payload`] copies the same files straight
//! into `.adds/cobalt` on the mounted volume, which is a plain folder copy the
//! reader never elevates. The worst outcome of a setup that goes wrong is a
//! folder to delete.
//!
//! # What that costs
//!
//! A folder copy does not trigger the firmware's update-and-restart, so the
//! reader has to be restarted by hand for [`enable_ssh`] to take effect. That
//! is one button held down, in exchange for never handing the boot script an
//! archive. It is the right trade.

Cobalt itself is started from the Cobalt entry in the reader's own menu, or

screen; a restart always returns to the stock reader.

After a restart, leave the home screen alone for one minute before opening the
menu. NickelMenu uses that window as a boot-loop failsafe and disables itself
after an interrupted startup.

The reader is also set to stay awake for ninety minutes rather than a few, so
that it is still reachable when you come back to it. That costs battery. The
reader's own Energy saving screen changes it back at any time, as does
'kobo setup --undo'.

That undo removes the managed Cobalt trees, .adds/cobalt-launch.sh, and the
exact Cobalt NickelMenu entry. It moves owner folders to
.adds/cobalt.recovery.N first and leaves .adds/cobalt.unusable[.N] quarantines
for inspection, so recoverable data is never silently deleted.
