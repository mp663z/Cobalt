//! A book on the panel, and everything a reader does to one.
//!
//! # Why a position is a place in the book and never a page number
//!
//! Page 47 is not a location. Make the type larger and page 47 is somewhere
//! else; the same book on the same device with the same reader is suddenly
//! forty pages further on than it was a moment ago. Every stock reader ever
//! made has had to learn this, and the ones that got it wrong are the ones
//! that lose your place when you change the font.
//!
//! So everything remembered here (where you are, what you marked, what you
//! bookmarked) is a [`Locator`], which is an index into the parsed document.
//! Pages are derived from the document and the current type size, and are
//! thrown away and rebuilt whenever either changes. Changing the type size
//! repaginates and then goes back to the block that was at the top of the
//! page, so the words under your thumb are still there afterwards.
//!
//! # Why this paginates rather than calling `paginate`
//!
//! [`kobo_ui::paginate`] sets everything at body size, because it takes a
//! string and a string has no structure. A book does: a chapter heading is
//! larger, a list item is indented, and each of those is a different height.
//! Measuring them all as body text puts the last lines of a page below the
//! bottom of the panel: the layout engine drops whatever does not fit,
//! silently, and the reader sees a page that stops mid-sentence.
//!
//! # Why a highlight is drawn as a quote
//!
//! There is no text selection on this panel and there should not be: selecting
//! a phrase needs a cursor a finger cannot place on a display that takes most
//! of a second to repaint. So the unit of highlighting is the paragraph, which
//! is what a tap can address, and a highlighted paragraph is set as a
//! depth-one quote, indented, with a rule down the left. That is what a marked
//! passage looks like in a printed book, it needs nothing new from the
//! renderer, and because the paragraph is *paginated* at that depth as well,
//! marking one never pushes the foot of the page off the bottom.
