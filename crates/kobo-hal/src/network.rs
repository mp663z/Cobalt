//! Keeping the network alive across a reader handoff.
//!
//! Stopping and restarting the stock reader reliably drops the Wi-Fi
//! connection. The reader owns the radio, and the restarted one begins from its
//! own "not connected" state, so the association and the lease are simply gone.
//! On a device managed over Wi-Fi that means every handoff can cost the
//! connection used to run it, which was measured rather than assumed: the
//! device became unreachable after a session and only came back when its owner
//! tapped through the reader's own network UI.
//!
//! There is no supported way to ask the reader to reconnect. It exposes no
//! D-Bus service; the session bus carries only `Fontickel`, `Sickel` and the
//! bus itself. `/tmp/nickel-hardware-status` is one-way reporting rather than
//! control: the stock scripts write `network <action> ip=…` into it to say what
//! has already happened. There is no wifi script to call either, because
//! `libnickel` drives the radio internally.
//!
//! What is left is to put back exactly what was running. This module records
//! the supplicant and DHCP client while they are still alive, and starts those
//! same programs again, with their own arguments and environment, if the
//! connection has not returned on its own. Nothing here invents a
//! configuration, chooses a network, or writes to persistent storage, and
//! everything it does is undone by a reboot.
//!
//! Deliberately not done: writing to `/tmp/nickel-hardware-status` to correct
//! the reader's indicator. That FIFO blocks until something reads it, which is
//! why the stock scripts background every write to it, and a cosmetic icon is
//! not worth a runtime that can hang.
