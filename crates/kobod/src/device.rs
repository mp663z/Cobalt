//! Running an application on the panel.
//!
//! This is the mode in which the platform actually owns the device: the stock
//! reader is stopped, the framebuffer and touch panel belong to us, and an
//! application's screens are what the owner sees.
//!
//! The ordering here is the whole safety argument, so it is written out rather
//! than left implicit.
//!
//! Acquire, in this order:
//!
//! 1. Find the reader and save how to restart it.
//! 2. Arm a watchdog that restarts it even if we are killed outright.
//! 3. Open the display, which validates the hardware profile exactly.
//! 4. Snapshot the whole screen.
//! 5. Take the touch panel.
//! 6. Suspend Kobo's freeze watchdog.
//! 7. Only now stop the reader.
//!
//! Step 6 is not optional and its position is not arbitrary. `sickel` reboots
//! the device when the reader stops pinging it, and it cannot tell a reader we
//! stopped on purpose from one that hung. Suspending it after stopping the
//! reader would leave a window in which the device could reboot underneath us.
//!
//! Nothing that can fail is left until after the reader is down. If the profile
//! does not match, or the panel is busy, or the screen cannot be captured, we
//! find out while the device is still completely untouched.
//!
//! Release runs in the exact reverse order and, critically, runs on *every*
//! path: normal exit, application crash, protocol violation, and deadline.
//! Release builds abort on panic, so no `Drop` implementation would run; the
//! unwinding is therefore explicit and centralised in one function rather than
//! spread across returns.
