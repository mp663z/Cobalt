//! A profile assembled from what an unmeasured device says about itself.
//!
//! Every profile in [`crate::SUPPORTED_PROFILES`] is a record of somebody
//! holding the hardware: the panel was written to, corners were tapped, the
//! reader was handed back. That is why the table is short, and why owners of a
//! Kobo nobody here has ever touched were refused outright.
//!
//! Refusing them was the wrong trade. Almost everything a profile states is
//! read back from the kernel at probe time and needs no witness: the
//! framebuffer's geometry, its pixel layout, the touch controller's name and
//! the ranges it reports. What genuinely cannot be derived is how the digitiser
//! is mounted underneath the panel, which is a fact about solder and no
//! register records it.
//!
//! So a provisional profile carries the derived fields and leaves that one gap
//! honest. It is never `write_ready`, so it cannot reach a panel until the
//! owner has been told what it is and has said yes. What it buys is that an
//! owner of a Nia or an Aura gets a screen and a choice rather than a device
//! that appears to do nothing.
