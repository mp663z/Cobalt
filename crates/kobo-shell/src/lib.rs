//! One application's terminal, hosted by the runtime.
//!
//! The application never holds the pseudo-terminal, never forks a process and
//! never sees a file descriptor. It sends [`ShellRequest`] and receives
//! [`ShellEvent`], exactly the way it reaches the network and its own state.
//! That is not ceremony: it is the only place a refusal can be enforced, a
//! chunk can be bounded, and a program can be stopped when its application
//! goes away.
//!
//! The same code runs in the daemon and in the browser simulator, so a
//! terminal behaves the same on a development host as on the panel and a
//! difference between them cannot be introduced by having written it twice.
//!
//! # Why this is the dangerous one
//!
//! Every other capability in this platform is undone by a reboot. A shell on
//! this device is root on a writable root filesystem, so it is the first
//! feature capable of producing a device that a power cycle does not repair.
//! It is refused unless the application declared [`Capability::Shell`], and a
//! runtime that has no business offering one constructs [`Shells::refused`].
